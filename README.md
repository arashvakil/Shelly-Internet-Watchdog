# Shelly-Internet-Watchdog
This project contains a set of Shelly scripts designed to monitor the connectivity of your modem and router. The scripts periodically ping external endpoints (such as Cloudflare and Google) to ensure that your internet connection is stable. If connectivity is lost, the script automatically reboots the device and sends notifications via Telegram.
